------------------[ README ]------------------
convert between plaintext files and tokenised
files for the TI8x series of calculators

options:
 -h
	display help dialogue

 -t <axe|basic|grammer>
	define token set to be used.

 -i <filename>
	define file to be read

 -o <filename>
	define file to be written (write to stdout by default)

 -n <name>
	define on-calc name (warning: does not check name validity)

 -a
	generate archived program

 -p
	use "pretty" output (use unicode approximations that
	more closely resemble the true appearances)

 -s
	strip excess data (comments, spaces, empty lines, etc)

 -f
	force (skip over any unmatched tokens rather than generating an error)

running without -i causes the program to read from stdin, and running
without -o to write to stdout.

running with only a string as an argument yields
a single token lookup in the following format:
"<token name>":<token set>:<token number>

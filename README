convert plain text files into tokenised
files for the TI-8x series of calculators

planned features include conversion from
multiple different token sets (BASIC, Axe,
Grammer, etc) to programs or appvars and
maybe a few other small things. also, once
everything is done, the reverse process
shouldn't be too difficult...
